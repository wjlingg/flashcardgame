A program for practicing 4 arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Steps taken during implementation:

1) Added base layout for the user interface
2) Added logic for countdown timer
3) Added logic for the 4 arithmetic operations
4) Added logic for generating question and scoring
5) Improved UI

Features:

1) ***Score*** : one point awarded for correct answers, one point deducted for incorrect answers
2) ***Operations*** : choose between 4 arithmetic operations
3) ***Timer*** : one minute countdown of play
4) ***Answered correctly*** : number of questions answered correctly
5) ***Answered wrongly *** : number of questions answered wrongly
6) ***Questions*** : display random-generated equations of the selected operation type
7) ***User input*** : takes in user input
8) ***Number of questions left*** : display the number of questions left in question bank
9) ***Start button*** : start the game, timer will start counting down
10) ***Enter button*** : submit answer

How to play:

1) Select the type of operations from the drop down list: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (default "multiplication" is selected)
2) Click "Start" button to start the game, timer will immediately counts down
3) Enter your answer to the generated questions
4) Click "Enter" button to submit answer or press "Enter" key on keyboard to submit answer
5) Game will stop once all questions in question bank have been answered or once the timer runs out of time
6) Dialog box will show your percentage score and accruacy once game ends

Future work:

1) Able to generate question randomly among the 4 arithmetic operations (single type in each question)
2) Able to generate question randomly among the 4 arithmetic operations (multiple types in each question)
3) Able to generate question randomly with modulo operations
4) Able to set your own time or disable time
5) Restart the game even if there are time or there are questions left in question bank
